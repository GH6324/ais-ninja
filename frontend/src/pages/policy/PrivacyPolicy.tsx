			<h2>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</h2>
			<p>Our employees are familiar with our security policy, and access to Personally Identifiable Information is
				limited to a qualified few. We regularly audit our security systems and processes. While we take

				errors,
				tampering, and unauthorized access.

				Information
				from our database. However, residual information may remain due to backups and record-keeping purposes.
				Future
				use of the information will be discontinued.
			</p>

			<h2>What happens if the Privacy Policy changes?</h2>
			<p>If we make changes to our privacy policy that could disclose Personally Identifiable Information
				previously
				requested not to be disclosed, we will contact the affected individuals to allow them to prevent such
				disclosure.
