## IMDB Need to pay.

The IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is a well-known database website for movies and TV shows. IMDb provides a vast amount
of information about movies, TV shows, actors, directors, writers, and other related personnel. The IMDb API (
Application Programming Interface) allows developers to programmatically access and retrieve data from IMDb.

The IMDb API offers a rich set of endpoints that developers can use to perform various operations. Here are some common
API endpoints:

Search: Allows searching for movies, TV shows, actors, and more based on keywords. Searches can be performed using
titles, genres, years, and other criteria.

Movie and TV show details: Provides detailed information about a specific movie or TV show, including plot summaries,
cast lists, directors, writers, release dates, ratings, and more.

Actor and crew details: Retrieves information about actors, directors, writers, and other crew members involved in
movies and TV shows. This includes biographical data, filmography, and other relevant details.

Ratings and reviews: Enables accessing user ratings and reviews for movies and TV shows. This allows developers to
retrieve audience opinions and feedback.

Box office data: Provides data related to movie box office performance, such as gross earnings, opening weekend figures,
and international sales.

Developers can utilize the IMDb API to integrate IMDb's vast collection of movie and TV show information into their
applications, websites, or services, enriching the user experience with reliable and comprehensive data from IMDb.
